# Cemetery

As medicine pregressed using corpse, I want to learn resuming
old vulnerabilities.

 - [Shellshock/CVE-2014-6271](CVE-2014-6271/README.md)
 - [ImageTragick/CVE-2016â€“3714](CVE-2016-3714/README.md)
 - [DirtyCow/CVE-2016-5195](CVE-2016-5195/README.md)
 - [CVE-2017-5030](CVE-2017-5030/README.md) Chrome Out-of-bounds read in V8 Array.concat
 - [CVE-2018-10115](CVE-2018-10115/README.md) 7-Zip uninitalized memory
 - [CVE-2016-4622](CVE-2016-4622/README.md) WebKit
 - [CVE-2021-27365](CVE-2021-27365) ISCSI out of bound kernel heap write

## Meta

Resurrect corpes, I mean, vulnerabilities, can be troublesome

### Qemu

It's pretty cool to use ``qemu`` to run different kernels or debug them.

BTW sometimes it's a pain: so here some troubleshooting

 - try ``-m 1024`` if panic
 - ``Could not read from CD-ROM (code 0009)``: download desktop version

### Old Ubuntu releases

You can grab them from [http://old-releases.ubuntu.com](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com).

### Debian kernel package

For Debian exists [snapshot.debian.org](http://snapshot.debian.org) to retrieve
old packages.

Take in mind that to find a specific vulnerable kernel package you have to read
what is vulnerable from the specific **vulnerability tracker** [here for dirtycow](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5195)
and probably you will find the source package; after that you must look at
what packages have been generated from that (search on snapshot site the source package's
name, look for the specific version from all the available ones and then there is
a section named **Binary packages**).

After that, some kernel need an initrd that is generated when installed, without
it the system fails to boot since at least the module to mount the root filesystem is needed.

The best option is probably use ``docker``: insert a unique entry for snapshot.debian.org
that makes sense, install the kernel and after that copy the ``initrd`` from the ``/boot``
directory.

### Root filesystem

If you have a root filesystem contained in a tar archive, you can create
an empty file large enough, mount it and untarring the archive into it.

```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs.ext4 status=progress bs=1M count=1024
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 rootfs.ext4 
$ mkdir mount
$ mount -o loop rootfs.ext4 mount
$ sudo mount -o loop rootfs.ext4 mount
$ sudo tar -xvf /tmp/amd64-rootfs-20170318T102216Z.tar.gz -C mount
$ sudo umount mount
```
